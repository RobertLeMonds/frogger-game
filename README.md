# How to Play Crossroads Mini-Game & Running the game
===============================

## Running the Game
1. The easiest method to run the game is by going to https://robertlemonds.github.io/frogger-game/gamepage.html
2. If you want you can also git clone and download the zip. Unzip the files and double click index.html in the frogger-game file to run the website locally.

## Rules

1. At the Home page press start (blue button) to begin.
2. The object of the game is to avoid the bugs and get to the other side.
3. If you get hit with a bug, the game starts over from the beginning.

## How to play
1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move your character around.
2. When moving around try to avoid getting hit by a bug.
3. Once getting to the blue water you are safe and you win! Easy! :)

### Future plans are to add lives, a points system, and levels to make the game more challenging.
