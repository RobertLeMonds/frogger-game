# How to Play Crossroads Mini-Game
===============================

## Rules

1. At the Home page press start (blue button) to begin.
2. The object of the game is to avoid the bugs and get to the other side.
3. If you get hit with a bug, the game starts over from the beginning.

## How to play
1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move your character around.
2. When moving around try to avoid getting hit by a bug.
3. Once getting to the blue water you are safe and you win! Easy! :)

### Future plans are to add lives, a points system, and levels to make the game more challenging.
